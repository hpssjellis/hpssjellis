#### I simplify Robotics and Machine Learning


## Maker100
Presenlty working on improving my 7 year student tested Arduino Clone Robotics course [old course here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics) to a new robotics and Machine Learning course called [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) designed for any non-engineering program and is planned to be ready for Jan 2022.

The coure introduces all the hands on basics of robotics sensors and actuators, with a simplified [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) Machine Learning introduction all based around the new Arduino Pro boards: ~$100 USD Portenta, ~$50 USD Portenta Vision shields (Ethernet and LoRaWan), ~$50 USD Portenta Breakout Board. The course uses my ever changing offical Arduino IDE Library of examples [portenta-pro-community-solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions)


## Maker101

In researching the above Robotics Machine Learning Maker 100 program, I designed a simplified way to use TensorflowJS and TensorflowLite/micro with the Arduino boards. It is too complex for my High School students but would work well for a web based Javascript and Arduino C++ introduction to GoogleAI

**I would be willing to work over the duration of a few years with a University Professor on a paid Google or other program to develop a TensorflowJS and TensorFlowMicro course as a University introduction to TinyML, Tensorflow and Machine Learning.** Using my working code, adapted with the Professors ideas and theory. Potentially my hands on videos, with the Professors theory videos. 

My TensorflowJS site is [www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/) Note: everything is Vanilla Javascript as easy as possible. Examples are clear, Keras based and simple for students to build from.

My best, easiest TensorflowJS Vanilla Javascript example is this [xOr example](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/20keras-xOr.html)

My TinyML Portenta examples site is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow) although an easier example is on the above library.
