I help to bring Tiny ML to universities in developing countires  https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/team and hopefully this group will publish a paper about the process later this year (2024)

I am in the top 25 (July 2024) of Github Open Source contributors for Canada (hpssjellis) see website at  https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/canada.md

First academic paper  [TinyML4D: Scaling Embedded Machine LearningEducation in the Developing World](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI-SS/article/view/31265/33425) started during the workshop at:  [ICTP Italy Summer 2023](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10185) 

[V.J. Reddi mention 5 leads in tinyML including me](https://youtu.be/pbFYiR2sTlY?si=W9fia8U7jdUbsF2U&t=2689) https://youtu.be/pbFYiR2sTlY?si=W9fia8U7jdUbsF2U&t=2689 which is at 
44:49


All my life I have enjoyed middle distance running, but by 60 I could not even jog, so I trained for a year and a half and won the Canadian National 55plus 800m male 60-64 year old age group  in Quebec City Aug 2024. [results look for me](https://canada55plusqc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Track-Field_2024.pdf) I will not race again until I can do much better than a time of 2:43

## RocksettaTinyML Arduino Library
Surprisingly usefull, small tensorflowLite-micro library for the Arduno IDE. This time you need to download the zipped file from the github and install 
using ( Sketch-->include library --> add .zip Library). Very small and easy to use tensorflow micro library. Try the sine wave and view the plotter to see if it works on your microcontroller.

Having taught computer coding for over 3 decades I have not held back on any of my ideas about these glasses. This review is a must if you are thinking about getting any smart glasses. The lack of a camera is actually a super power. No camera means no rediculus power consumption the G1 small battery can last the entire day and also no need to upgrade these glasses every 6 months. No camera means no intense need for the latst CPU speed and memory. My Garmin watch is fairly old and I am expecting these glasses to last a while.

My one will use simple LoRa P2P with a 10 byte exchange of information which the user can decide what each byte represents. Since this is strictly for machine learning, 10 bytes should be completely enough data stream to say what machine and what result: example 4 bytes identify the machine 6 bytes the result or whatever your situation needs. A type of encryption based on the code being unknown. This example will use the [Seeedstudio $9.90 USD Xiao-Esp32s3 with the wio-sx1262](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/wio_sx1262_with_xiao_esp32s3_kit/)  using the Arduino IDE and simplified code, but might be able to be converted to any other microcontroller.

Then the LLM can intelligently monitor the sensors and intelligently (hopefully) determine a response for actuators to do. Locally through webSerial on connected to the main LLM or through IoT to other devices within the same area or online. Basically I am starting an entire new industry that democratizes the potentailly intelligent use of EdgeAI and TinyML devices, all with the abillity to fully work offline even from boot. Note: The example single page applications need to be downloaded to the computer, ran once with the internet connectedd and then the LLM models are cached for future use.   |  Started 2023 with webSerial     55%          |

#### I simplify Robotics and Machine Learning

I am a technology teacher from BC, Canada.



## [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100)
Presently working on improving my 7 year student tested Arduino Clone Robotics course [old course here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics) to a new robotics and Machine Learning course called [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) designed for any non-engineering University program and is planned to be ready for Jan 2022.

The course introduces all the hands on basics of robotics; sensors and actuators, with a simplified [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) Machine Learning introduction all based around the (in my opinion) best all round microcontroller the new Arduino Pro boards: ~$100 USD [PortentaH7](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-h7) the easy to program dual core 160 pin cybertruck of an Arduino, ~$50 USD Portenta Vision shields ([Ethernet](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield) and [LoRaWan](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield-lora)), ~$50 USD [Portenta Breakout Board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-breakout). The course uses my ever-changing offical Arduino IDE Library of examples [portenta-pro-community-solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions)


### Showing the Dual Core, 160 Pin, PortentaH7 on a breadboard upside down so the snap on Ethernet Vision Shield, Camera and Microphones are facing up, but still with easy access to the SD card and control button, visible is the Wifi and BLE antenae.
Needs extra male and female headers to do this.

## [Maker101](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker101)

In researching the above Robotics Machine Learning Maker 100 program, I designed a simplified way to use TensorflowJS and TensorflowLite/micro with the Arduino boards. It is too complex for my High School students but would work well for a web based Javascript and Arduino C++ introduction to GoogleAI

**I would be willing to work over the duration of a few years with a University Professor on a paid [Google](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/06/2021-request-for-proposals-ml-faculty-awards.html?m=1) or other program to develop a TensorflowJS and TensorFlowMicro course as a University introduction to TinyML, Tensorflow and Machine Learning.** Using my working code, adapted with the Professors ideas and theory. Potentially my hands on videos, with the Professors theory videos. 

My TensorflowJS site is [www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/) Note: everything is Vanilla Javascript as easy as possible. Examples are clear, Keras based and simple for students to build from.

My best, easiest TensorflowJS Vanilla Javascript example is this [xOr example](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/20keras-xOr.html)

My TinyML Portenta examples site is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow) although an easier example is on the above library.

## Other 

I get migraines but am wading through the Snake Oil and will eventually be able to reduce it from about 1 every 3 weeks, to a much lower number. Getting used to multiple migraines the first week of school. My migraine repositiroy is [pre-migraine](https://github.com/hpssjellis/pre-migraine)

Both my arms dislocate, but I find that the less I play: rugby, kayak, rockclimb, volleyball, pillow fight the less it is a problem.

I don't seem to have as good control of my memory as I would like.
