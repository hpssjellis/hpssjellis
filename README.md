#### I simplify Robotics and Machine Learning


## Maker100
Presenlty working on improving my 7 year student tested Arduino Clone Robotics course [old course here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics) to a new robotics and Machine Learning course called [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) designed for any non-engineering program pallned to be ready for Jan 2022.

The coure introduces all the hands on basics of robotics sensors and actuators, with simplified [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) introductions all based around the new Arduino Pro boards: Portenta, Portenta Vision shields, Portenta Breakout Board. The course uses my ever changing offical Arduino IDE Library of examples [portenta-pro-community-solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions)


## Maker101

In researching the above Robotics Machine Learning Maker 100 program, I designed a simplified way to use TensorflowJS and TensorflowLite/micro with the Arduino boards. It is too complex for my High School students but would work well for a web based and Arduino introduction to GoogleAI

I would be willing to work with a few University Professors on a Paid Google program to develop a TensorflowJS and TensorFlowMicro course for an introductory TinyML and Machine Learning course.

My TensorflowJS site is [www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/) Note: everything is vanila Javascript as easy as possible. Examples are clear, Keras based and simple for students to build from.

best easy example is this [xOr example](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/20keras-xOr.html)

My TinyML examples site is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow) although an easier example is on the above library.
