I help to bring Tiny ML to universities in developing countires  https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/team and hopefully this group will publish a paper about the process later this year (2024)

I am a top 10 Github Open Source contributor for Canada (hpssjellis) see website at  https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/canada.md

First academic paper  [TinyML4D: Scaling Embedded Machine LearningEducation in the Developing World](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI-SS/article/view/31265/33425) started during the workshop at:  [ICTP Italy Summer 2023](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10185) 

 
# My Present (January 2024) Github Project Completion Estimates:
#### I like to stay busy.

With technology you start multiple projects and some of them are successful and others need updates or get deprecated or just aren't right for you. Here is my list!


| Title and  LInk   | Description | Percent Complete |

| <a name="45" href="#45">`45`</a>   [chatbot-learn-to-code](https://github.com/hpssjellis/chatbot-learn-to-code) |   My take on how to learn to code in an age when you can just talk to an LLM and it produces the code for you. Is that learning? We can ask an expert to do something for us, but does that have any learning value? Lets dig into possible ways to use chatBots to learn not just do the work for us. The demo webpage index is <a href="https://hpssjellis.github.io/chatbot-learn-to-code/public/index.html">here</a>     |       10%          | 
| <a name="44" href="#44">`44`</a>   [Demo recording-js-looper/](https://hpssjellis.github.io/recording-js-looper/) | Here is the github [recording-js-looper/](https://hpssjellis.github.io/recording-js-looper/)  This is an attempt to understand the Pros and Cons of using a chatBot to computer program. You get something that works really fast, but as you start developing it and making it fit your needs I found I got lost in how it worked and only minimally learnt anything. Cocnlusion, best to use the chatbot to teach you how to do advanced work but then do the advanced work yourself. I am going to do more work in this area.   |       90%          |

| <a name="42" href="#42">`42`</a>   [gitpod-wasm-emscripten-binaryen](https://github.com/hpssjellis/gitpod-wasm-emscripten-binaryen) |    Converting C++ code to WASM using [ENSCRIPTEN](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) and [BINARYEN](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) hopefully using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) or [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/) to make things much easier. Possible things to convert from C++ to WASM is the tensorflow-converter tool so it can be used from the web and even compiling Arduino code put on the web. I don't think this will work with tensorflowJS   |       90%  deprecated        | 
| <a name="41" href="#41">`41`</a>   [Rabbit R1](https://github.com/hpssjellis/rabbit-r1-personal-companion-unboxing) |    I have ordered a Rabbit R1 Personal Companion On Jan 9th, when I head about it. By January 10th it was sold out after the first 10K were ordered. I think a new round of ordering is possible or are they all pre-order? [rabbit.tech](https://www.rabbit.tech/). <br> I plan to do an uboxing video but mainly about Pros and Cons. Go to my github [issues](https://github.com/hpssjellis/rabbit-r1-personal-companion-unboxing/issues) and add possible things to try by going out on the rabbit r1    |       50%  A cool device but until "TeachMode" works this has not much interest for me. The rabbit hole is actually good for organizing your work.        |

Students need to get used to doing things that are not that much fun.   |       40%          | 
| <a name="39" href="#39">`39`</a>   [Maker100-eco](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100-eco) |    After the success of my [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) Robotics, IoT and TinyML Machine Learning course staring the $113.90 USD Arduino PortentaH7 with $69 USD LoRa Vision Shield I have decided to make an economic version of the in-preson course staring the [$13.99 USD Seeedstudio XiaoEsp32s](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/) and the [$14.50 USD RakWireless RAK2270StickerTracker](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak2270-rak-sticker-tracker?variant=43046272303302). This is an in-person course, the links and videos are organizational quick reminders of what to do to become proficient at Robotics (IoT and Machine Learing) with microcontrollers. Most of the rest of the course will need an instructor or be solved through research such as using ChatGPT etc.   [SeeedStdio Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA6JB-PzuUs&list=PL57Dnr1H_egu2b2lf6C6FAaUQlCViENYc) or the [RakWireless Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eye5zlfl3I8&list=PL57Dnr1H_egsfctG_K8AQ9uGhaLsTth6x)  |       90%     [Maker100-Eco Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Aucyd10Mtw&list=PL57Dnr1H_egt9XmHjfcyRR4YCo3eGrZwQ)     |

| <a name="36" href="#36">`36`</a>   [RocksettaTinyML](https://github.com/hpssjellis/RocksettaTinyML) |    I found a 3 year old library I made based on eleoquentTinyML that still loads machine learning models on Micro-controllers in a very simple way. Seriously easy. So I am adding relevant Nicla- Vision examples etc. Every ML model has an input array to a prediction that returns an output array, in whatever types you declare. That's it! Seems useful, since [Google TFLITE Micro](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro) has deprecated the Google [TFLM arduino examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples) library      |       80%   This will be used in the 2024 maker100-eco course see above       |

Making teaching machine learning possible from a single vanilla Javascript webpage using webSerial to load any sensor data from any microcontroller directly onto the webpage or from a previously saved CSV file and to train a TensorflowJS ML model and export that model or upload a saved model so that new incoming data can be graphed and classified. If needed the results can then be easily sent back to the microcontroller to control acutators.  Possibly the best thing I have every made!   |       75%   This also will be used in the 2024 maker100-eco course         |

#### I simplify Robotics and Machine Learning

I am a technology teacher from BC, Canada.



## [Maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100)
Presently working on improving my 7 year student tested Arduino Clone Robotics course [old course here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics) to a new robotics and Machine Learning course called [maker100](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker100) designed for any non-engineering University program and is planned to be ready for Jan 2022.

The course introduces all the hands on basics of robotics; sensors and actuators, with a simplified [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) Machine Learning introduction all based around the (in my opinion) best all round microcontroller the new Arduino Pro boards: ~$100 USD [PortentaH7](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-h7) the easy to program dual core 160 pin cybertruck of an Arduino, ~$50 USD Portenta Vision shields ([Ethernet](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield) and [LoRaWan](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-vision-shield-lora)), ~$50 USD [Portenta Breakout Board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/portenta-breakout). The course uses my ever-changing offical Arduino IDE Library of examples [portenta-pro-community-solutions](https://github.com/hpssjellis/portenta-pro-community-solutions)


### Showing the Dual Core, 160 Pin, PortentaH7 on a breadboard upside down so the snap on Ethernet Vision Shield, Camera and Microphones are facing up, but still with easy access to the SD card and control button, visible is the Wifi and BLE antenae.
Needs extra male and female headers to do this.

## [Maker101](https://github.com/hpssjellis/maker101)

In researching the above Robotics Machine Learning Maker 100 program, I designed a simplified way to use TensorflowJS and TensorflowLite/micro with the Arduino boards. It is too complex for my High School students but would work well for a web based Javascript and Arduino C++ introduction to GoogleAI

**I would be willing to work over the duration of a few years with a University Professor on a paid [Google](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/06/2021-request-for-proposals-ml-faculty-awards.html?m=1) or other program to develop a TensorflowJS and TensorFlowMicro course as a University introduction to TinyML, Tensorflow and Machine Learning.** Using my working code, adapted with the Professors ideas and theory. Potentially my hands on videos, with the Professors theory videos. 

My TensorflowJS site is [www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/) Note: everything is Vanilla Javascript as easy as possible. Examples are clear, Keras based and simple for students to build from.

My best, easiest TensorflowJS Vanilla Javascript example is this [xOr example](https://www.rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs/beginner-keras/20keras-xOr.html)

My TinyML Portenta examples site is [here](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-for-the-arduino-portentaH7/tree/master/m09-Tensoflow) although an easier example is on the above library.

## Other 

I get migraines but am wading through the Snake Oil and will eventually be able to reduce it from about 1 every 3 weeks, to a much lower number. Getting used to multiple migraines the first week of school. My migraine repositiroy is [pre-migraine](https://github.com/hpssjellis/pre-migraine)

Both my arms dislocate, but I find that the less I play: rugby, kayak, rockclimb, volleyball, pillow fight the less it is a problem.

I don't seem to have as good control of my memory as I would like.
